CSE4152 Coding Problem #2
Largest N numbers

Let M be an N × N integer matrix, where each element in M is distinct, ensuring that no two elements are equal. Propose an algorithm that efficiently identifies the N largest elements among the elements of M. Furthermore, provide a proof of the correctness of this algorithm. Note that the algorithm does not need to preserve M’s initial state.

Position of k

Consider an N × N matrix of integers where both its rows and columns are arranged in non-decreasing order. Propose an algorithm that, given such a matrix and an integer k, efficiently determines the position of k within the matrix. In cases where there are multiple occurrences of k in the matrix, the algorithm will identify one of them.
